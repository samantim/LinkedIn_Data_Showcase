## üìå About This Repo

Welcome to my **data showcase repo**, where I share everything I‚Äôm learning, building, and experimenting with ‚Äî from **data preprocessing** to **big data analysis**, cloud workflows, machine learning, and beyond.

These are **real, practical, and focused mini-projects** tied to the educational LinkedIn posts I‚Äôm publishing regularly.

üîó Fill the gap between theory and practice, and reuse what works!
